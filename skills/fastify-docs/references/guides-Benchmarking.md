# Benchmarking

## Benchmarking[​](#benchmarking "Direct link to Benchmarking")

Benchmarking is important if you want to measure how a change can affect your application's performance. We provide a simple way to benchmark your application from the point of view of a user and contributor. The setup allows you to automate benchmarks in different branches and on different Node.js versions.

The modules we will use:

* [Autocannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon): An HTTP/1.1 benchmarking tool written in node.
* [Branch-comparer](https://github.com/StarpTech/branch-comparer): Checkout multiple git branches, execute scripts, and log the results.
* [Concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently): Run commands concurrently.
* [Npx](https://github.com/npm/npx): NPM package runner used to run scripts against different Node.js Versions and execute local binaries. Shipped with npm\@5.2.0.
